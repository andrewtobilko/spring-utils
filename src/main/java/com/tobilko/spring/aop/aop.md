###AOP with Spring

**Main concepts**

- *aspect* is a concern that cuts across multiple classes (e.g. transaction management);
- *join point* is a point during the execution of a program (e.g method execution, exception handling); 
- *advice* (*interceptor*) is an action at a particular join point that an aspect takes;
- *pointput* is an expression that matches join points;
- *introduction* is declaring additional methods or fields on an advised object;
- *target* is object being advised by aspects;
- *proxy* is an object created to implement the aspect contracts;
- *wearing* is linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object.
