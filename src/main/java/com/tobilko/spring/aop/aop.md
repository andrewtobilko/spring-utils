###AOP with Spring

**Main concepts**

- *aspect* is a concern that cuts across multiple classes (e.g. transaction management)
- *join point* is a point during the execution of a program (e.g method execution, exception handling) 
- *advice* (*interceptor*) is an action at a particular join point that an aspect takes
- *pointput* is an expression that matches join points
